## 📖 Usage Guide

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `Walmart_sales_prediction.ipynb`
2. Run the cells sequentially to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis
   - Train and evaluate models
   - Generate predictions

## 📊 Dataset Features

The dataset includes the following features:
- Store: Store identifier
- Date: Week of sales
- Weekly_Sales: Sales for the given store
- Holiday_Flag: Whether the week is a special holiday week
- Temperature: Average temperature in the region
- Fuel_Price: Cost of fuel in the region
- CPI: Consumer Price Index
- Unemployment: Unemployment rate

## 📈 Model Performance

Models are evaluated using:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared Score
- Cross-validation scores
